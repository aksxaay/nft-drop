# ai art pfp setup md

Basically what we had in mind is 
4^5 
5^4 
total collection umber, that is claimable for me to be able to manage it in a short span of time.

There's also website that could help me with ai.

I am also ready to ask wacks if I could have his pfps in order to make mutatations art ai inspired by wacks. and have it watermarked and things.

what about google doodles kinda thing?
[ml5js](https://ml5js.org/) - whole ass ml library for js


[ritik-rohan-ai-generator](https://github.com/ritikrohan/NFTgenerator) too primitive however.

[google-colab-tensorflow-neural-style-implementation](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/tutorials/generative/style_transfer.ipynb)
these both are similar I think.

style transfer could be interesting, but I have to experiment.

I also thought about how github has its image unique identification kinda thing. We could try and replicate that from like an eth address I suppose.


i'm doing the google colab style transfer and the results are kinda nice lmao. that's kinda crazy, how many texture I might be able to create.

I'm also thinking of adding later in some weird blend mode kinda thing which does.


testing styles
- starry night van gogh
- Wassily Kandinsky
- I could do this Basquiat


a website that had experimented with style-transfer
had recommended this
[mtyka-neural-artistic-style](https://github.com/mtyka/neural_artistic_style)
[experiments with style-transfer](https://genekogan.com/works/style-transfer/)

there's also stylegan? ayo wth.
style gan can merge faces, I wonder if it can merge other deekay faces or something.

man gimp is such a pain in the ass.

here's also a list of all github similar identicons (their image generated unique identifiers)
[awesome-identicons](https://github.com/drhus/awesome-identicons)


okay let me temporarily mess around with the identicons

### Nominated Ones
- [Jazzicon](https://github.com/danfinlay/jazzicon)
- [Ringicon](https://github.com/splitbrain/php-ringicon) - fav
- [Circular](https://github.com/ea7ababe/identicon)
- [Gradient](https://github.com/tobiaslins/avatar)
- [Polkadot](https://github.com/paritytech/oo7/tree/master/packages/polkadot-identicon)



wait dude that's really cool I could also get typeracer to be able to hold your record in NFTs that's fucking sick. if I can figure out a valid way to do that idk.


failed [stylegan2](https://colab.research.google.com/github/parthsuresh/stylegan2-colab/blob/master/StyleGAN2_Google_Colab.ipynb#scrollTo=4yYOy9ZsH19O)

there's a stylegan3 hopefully it's now updated ig?

now this was cool, don't get me wrong, but GAN isn't exactly what I thought it was.
It needs this "latent" space to evaluate, so that's that. so it finds someone close to our faces, but not quite. Also it was only built for Human Faces, I'm going to have to train it for Deekay's damn thing if I wanted it exactly like that.

idk should I be training these?

wait this dude also trains these? that's crazy
he does a complete comparison, now I have to probably focus on data gathering and cleaning.
10% / month is technically doable.

there's this script you need to run that regularly pings you so it doesn't get knocked off in google colab free. 

so first I'm training this GAN
and then I can generate. I have to watch this video again. 
but we essentially need to save these pkl files.

okay now I have to gather the images.

okay wait here are the NFT links
- [Let's walk collection](https://opensea.io/collection/letswalk)
- [etherscan contract address](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0825f050e9b021a0e9de8cb1fb10b6c9f41e834c)


okay i'm sorta starting to understand how the extraction goes like?
