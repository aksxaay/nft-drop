okay i'm sorta starting to understand how the extraction goes like?

here's where I'll document the scraping involved

its goddamn 3.5 mb
500 mb sorta?

I remember me doing this typa shi before I should have experience downloading deekay arts

Okay Im gonna try using rarible's search feature thingy.

rarible's api seems okay.


the one api I have used you can right away save it as gif from the ipfs given, BUT. this has some serious issues.

I can't get all the damn items that exist. Only the ones that are on sale?
i have to further investigate.

there's also this total number that bothers me.
Says there's only 50.

okay I just had to specify size and now I'm g.

right now it is sorted by name which I don't mind tbh? this is okay.

there's no point sorting, this data needs a bunch of **cleaning**.

i can either do using
the lh3 googleusercontent or download straight off of web3 servers idk.

I'd rather prefer the gif cuz I could sorta work my way around it?

representation preview makes it tiny possible easier to train from the image

some of them dont' have the google preview that's sad bruh.

there's this feeling of uncertainty that you're not able to put your finger quite on. This is because of no practice and the fact that you have to test every step along the way.





AHHAHA while running it I used so wack ass syntax so I deserved that LMAO

let's try threading backwards, because this makes 1 thread basically useless.

restarted the kernel

so there's 120 frames in each gif, we need to see which is the best one.

so basically it's only good when it's ascending the seek and not right away jump lemme see

i forgot to resize them bruh fuck my life. resize them to 512 bruh fuck me.

the resize of PIL quality was pissing me off. this shit sucked.

so basically I couldn't get GIMP to scale either, and PIL was causing most of the problems.

OMG I just had to bump back the version on the google colab, why didn't I get that right away, I'm such a noob

man.
